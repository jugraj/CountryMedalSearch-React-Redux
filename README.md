## Draw Group Programming Task

### Completed the task:

- Countries can be added via the input field and on submit it fetches the data from a fake JSON file stored in  src/assets/data/countries.json
- The output is already sorted based on the ranking but an be sorted by clicking the `heading` of each column.
- country Flag also added.

### Functionality points to be noted:
 - The user can input in lower or upper case.
 - The App uses React and Redux with Thunk as main dependencies.
 - The countries/medals stats are fake and just added from an JSON object. The only external call is possibly to the flag image.
 - Currently the functionality doesnt support duplicate items (countries) being pushed to the state. 

### How to build:

1. npm i
2. npm start - it will compile to http://localhost:3000/
